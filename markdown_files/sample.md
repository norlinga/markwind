# This is from the sample markdown file!!!

Here is a simple footnote[^1]. With some additional text after it.

[^1]: My reference


hello


- lists are defined
- in several ways
- in Markdown.  This one is unordered.

### What happens if we make a table?

| id | name      |
|--- |---        |
| 1  | Aaron     |
| 2  | Not Aaron |

And there we go!  Enjoy Markdown...ing.
